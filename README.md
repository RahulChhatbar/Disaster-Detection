# Disaster Detect

Disaster Detect is a project focused on the automated detection of natural disasters using machine learning techniques. The project employs various algorithms to classify events as natural disasters or not based on input data.

## Overview

Natural disasters pose significant threats to lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Timely detection and response are critical for minimizing their impact. Disaster Detect aims to automate this detection process, providing faster response times and potentially saving lives. As natural disasters escalate in frequency and intensity due to climate change, rapid and precise identification becomes paramount.

The project leverages technological advancements, including advanced sensor networks, satellite imagery, and artificial intelligence, to enhance disaster detection efficiency. It focuses on implementing state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification and object detection methods. By combining these techniques, it aims to develop a robust system capable of swiftly identifying anomalies indicative of various disasters like wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms. Remote sensing technologies, especially satellite imagery and aerial monitoring, enable real-time surveillance of extensive geographical areas, empowering the system to detect and respond to potential threats promptly.

To achieve its goals, the project conducts comprehensive research into effective SOTA methods, establishes diverse datasets for training and validation, and develops a prototype system. Disaster Detect represents a crucial step forward in leveraging AI to bolster disaster detection capabilities, contributing to community resilience in the face of evolving environmental challenges.
